/**
 * This abomination created by nfischer on 7/9/2015.
 *
 * The Router determines which route should be used for a certain path.
 * Routes are considered in the order in which they were added to the Router, or equivalently, the order in which they appear in the routes List.
 * It is recommended that the anchors ^ and $ are used to in Route regex. If anchors are not used then routes should be added in order of decreasing specificity.
 *      This way paths like /things/thing and /things are not sent to the wrong Route and Controller.
